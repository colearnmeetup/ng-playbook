#About this project
We were after a simple playbook for the CoLearn Meetup project.  The idea for the innovation playbook came out of the first CoLearn Meetup. The playbook is designed to be a publically written document that serves to test assumptions about teaching and learning and provide guidelines for innovation in teaching practice. Testing the plays serves as further validation or invalidation for their effectiveness. The aim is to roadtest the plays in a wide variety of contexts.

Edit the plays folder to create your own plays. Play files need to be numbered sequentially eg 01.md, 02.md with the header containing the play_number and title as per the Digial Services Playbook.

The introduction.md file found in the includes folder can also be edited using markdown.

#To install
Just copy all the files to the folder of your choice.

Currently you will need to edit the url (which is my local test server) in the ng-playook.js file - this will be fixed soon.
